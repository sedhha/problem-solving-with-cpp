This is the repository containing all the problem-solving I have practiced using C++.

Have added bitwise operators yesterday. Will work more on adding new programs.

Added Encoded Permutations, however, the code is failing so will be updating changes to make it work.

Need to work on the permutations problem. It's still pending updates.

Unknown programs not pushed
Need to run new test cases
